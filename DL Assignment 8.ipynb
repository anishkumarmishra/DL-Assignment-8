        "\n",
        "Pros:\n",
        "\n",

        "  **Approximation:** Sampled softmax introduces an approximation error by not considering all classes, which can affect the accuracy of the model to some extent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The choice of sampling techniques, sampling size, and other hyperparameters can significantly impact the effectiveness of sampled softmax.\n",

        "In summary, sampled softmax is useful in scenarios where the computational cost of traditional softmax becomes prohibitive due to a large output space. It's employed to efficiently handle training and computation for tasks with vast output vocabularies or class spaces, providing a trade-off between computational efficiency and model accuracy."
